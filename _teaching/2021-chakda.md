I taught Statistics to undergraduate students as their minors from {{page.start_year}} to {{page.end_year}}. I covered topics like probability, regression analysis, design of experiment, time series analysis and statistical quality control. The teaching experience involved in-person and online sessions with the students, as well as preparing exams and grading them.
