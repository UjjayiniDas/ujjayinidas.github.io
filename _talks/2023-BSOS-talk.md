This talk featured a Shiny interactive tutorial I made for helping students without technical background to learn coding in R from scracth. The tutorials had modules on basic to intermediate level of programming with exercises at the end of each module. The interactive modules were designed to give feedback, encourage students upon attempting the exercises. The Shiny app was hosted in the College of Behavioral and Social Science server for students to access.
