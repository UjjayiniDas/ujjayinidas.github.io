**About me**
===========
![University of Maryland College Park Campus](/images/UMD pic.png){: .align=center height="400px"}
I am a PhD candidate at the Joint program in Survey Methodology [(JPSM)](https://jpsm.umd.edu/) at University of Maryland, College Park. It is a joint program with Univesrsity of Michigan, Ann Arbor. I completed my Bachelor's and Master's degree in Statistics from [University of Calcutta](https://www.caluniv.ac.in/academic/Statistics.html) in India. My primary research interests are:
- Statitstical methods of estimating health disparities from complex surveys
- Data integration methods
- Inference from nonprobability surveys
- Interviewer effect estimation in absence of an interpenetrated sampling design
- LLMs in survey research

I enjoy cooking, reading non-fictional literature, and creative writing in my leisure. I also love travelling and collecting souvenirs such as postcards and magnets from the places I visit!
