excerpt: 'Increasing nonresponse in household surveys in recent years has been a matter of
concern, especially regarding the quality of information produced from large scale
surveys with gradually decreasing response rates. In this research we explore if
there is any empirical relationship between social trust, both interpersonal and institutional,
and the survey response rates over time. We use social trust items measured
in General Social Survey (GSS) to answer our research question. Analyzing
data from 13 federally-administered national household surveys over two decades
spanning 2000 to 2022 using state-space models, we found mixed results indicating
that trust in both government and economic institutions yielded strong associations
between response rates and trust. However, we found limited evidence suggesting
that institutional trust bears an association with response rates to surveys related
to health. Overall our research tries to find the root causes of declining survey response
and motivates the discussion around social trust being a potential driver of
influencing an individual’s propensity to respond to surveys.'

In this increasingly insular world of people being immersed in work or being conscious of sharing information with others, it is a matter of concern to survey researchers whether people are motivated enough to take surveys. This article looks at social trust as a possible mechanism for nonresponse. Socioeconomic surveys like the ACS and CPS showed the strongest relation with trust in government and economic institutions. Comparatively, the authors found limited evidence suggesting that institutional trust bears an association with response rates to surveys related to health. Taken together, the results suggest that there is still work to be done to understand the root causes underlying declining survey response rates in the US federal surveys.
