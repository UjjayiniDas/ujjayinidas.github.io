excerpt: 'The rapid growth of artificial intelligence has been in the limelight for the past couple of yeras. While public sectors move towards adopting AI in their services, it is of prime interest to understand whether the same shift is happening inside givernment institutions. Especially, with the concern about bias and fairness regarding AI implementation, we seek answers to questions on how and where the US Federal Government agencies are at in terms of adopting AI.'

In this work, we explore the adoption rate of AI in Federal Goverment agencies by administering a survey. The work was presented at the FCSM conference in 2024 based on simulated data. This is a work in progress and the paper with findings from our survey will be made available soon. Please check back later!
